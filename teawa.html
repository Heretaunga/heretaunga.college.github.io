        <p>The river has been known by multiple names throughout history - Te Awa Kairangi, Heretaunga, Hutt River. Te Awa Kairangi, commonly known as the Hutt River, is a significant river located in Upper Hutt. The river's name, Te Awa Kairangi, comes from the Māori language and means "the river where food falls from the sky." It is a prominent feature of the Hutt Valley, which includes both the Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt cities. </p>

        <p>Mythological history tells of two taniwha, Ngake and Whaitaitai who lived in Wellington Harbour when it was just a lake. The lake eventually became too small for the taniwha and they longed to escape into the ocean to the south. Ngake positioned himself on the northern edge of the lake and using his tail like a spring thrust himself towards the southern shores, smashing a passageway through to what is today known as Cook Strait. The force of the release of Ngake’s coiled tailed carved Awakairangi - the Hutt Valley. Awakairangi is translated by some as “river of food from the sky”. As the name suggests, the Hutt Valley was once densely forested and abundant in bird life. Seafood formed a staple part of the diet of local Māori and until the early 1940s eel, crayfish and watercress were harvested from the Waiwhetu River. </p>

        <p>Historical records indicate that the first Europeans came to the ‘Valley of the Heretaunga River’, now known as Upper Hutt Valley, in the early 1840s. Development was slow in the first decade of settlement due to the poor state of access between the upper and lower valleys of the renamed Hutt River. The Hutt River was given its name by the New Zealand Company as a memorial to Sir William Hutt, the British Member of Parliament and former Chairman of the New Zealand Company. </p>

        <p>Upper Hutt became a city in 1966 and had a population of 20,000. Upper Hutt today has a growing population - as at June 2023 there were 48,300 residents in Upper Hutt! The settlement at  the southern end of the Upper Hutt basin is Trentham, well-known for its army camp, racecourse and memorial park. In 1841 John Barton purchased a large area beside the Hutt River. He named it Trentham after his childhood home in England. Much of his land was cleared, but significant tracts of forest survived and in 1950 were purchased as Upper Hutt’s Second World War memorial. These remnants are reminders of the tawa-podocarp forest that once covered the Hutt Valley.</p>

        <p>One kilometre south, Trentham Army Camp occupies a large area. During the First World War the Army built a large training camp there. It was used again during the Second World War and has since become a permanent facility. Nearby is Trentham Racecourse. Its buildings, erected by the Wellington Racing Club 1906, were used during the Second World War as a military hospital and also to house American troops. Since the war, Trentham has been extended, and is now one of the country’s finest racecourses. </p>
