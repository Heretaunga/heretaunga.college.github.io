        <p>Upper Hutt is in an area originally known as Orongomai. It means “the place of Rongomai”. He was an ancestor and patron of the tribes who came in the Kurahaupo canoe. According to their stories the captain was Whatonga, ancestor of the Ngai Tara and Rangitane tribes. By his first wife, Whatonga had a son, Tara-ika. His descendants, the Ngai Tara, were the first people known to live in the Wellington / Hutt Valley region and the harbour was named after Tara. </p>

        <p>The Ngati Rangi came and were defeated by the Ngati Ira. They in turn were defeated by Tāmati Wāka Nene of Ngapuhi and Te Rauparaha of Ngati Toa at Pa-Whakataka (across the bank from what is now Te Marua). Eventually the Taranaki people, Te Āti Awa, occupied all of the Hutt Valley shortly before the Europeans came, with villages at Te Hau-Karetu (Maoribank) and Whirinaki (Silverstream). Te Āti Awa are considered the tangata whenua of Upper Hutt. Members of Orongomai Marae can trace their origins back to those many tribes who came to the area. </p>

        <p>Orongomai Marae is a significant cultural and community centre located in Upper Hutt. A marae is a traditional Māori meeting ground or communal area that plays a central role in Māori culture and social life. Each marae typically serves as a place for Māori communities to gather, celebrate cultural events, conduct meetings, and engage in various traditional activities.</p>

        <p>Here are some key details about Orongomai Marae:<br>
Location: Orongomai Marae is situated in the city centre of Upper Hutt. <br>
Cultural Significance: Orongomai Marae holds great cultural significance for the local Māori community and is an essential part of their heritage. The marae serves as a place to preserve and celebrate Māori traditions, customs, and values.<br>
Facilities: Like many marae, Orongomai Marae typically features several important buildings and structures, including a wharenui (meeting house), wharekai (dining hall), and other outbuildings. These facilities are used for various events and activities, such as hui (meetings), powhiri (welcoming ceremonies), tangi (funerals), weddings, and cultural performances.<br>
Community Engagement: Orongomai Marae is not just a cultural site; it also serves as a hub for community engagement and development. Many marae, including Orongomai, host educational programs, health clinics, social services, and community events that benefit both Māori and non-Māori residents of the area.<br>
Cultural Preservation: The marae plays a vital role in preserving and passing on Māori culture, language, and traditions to younger generations. It serves as a place for learning about and connecting with Māori heritage. Orongomai Marae, like other marae in New Zealand, contributes significantly to the rich cultural tapestry of the country and provides a space for the Maori community to celebrate, connect, and engage with their cultural heritage.
