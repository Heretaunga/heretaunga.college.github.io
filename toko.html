        <p>In Māori tradition, Tokomaru was one of the great ocean-going canoes that were used in the migrations that settled New Zealand. It was commanded by Manaia. His brother-in-law had originally owned the canoe. When Manaia's wife was raped by a group of men, he slew them, including the chief Tupenu. Killing his brother-in-law, he took the Tokomaru and set sail with his family for New Zealand. Landing at Whangaparaoa, they finally settled at Taranaki. Te Āti Awa, Ngāti Mutunga, Ngāti Tama iwi trace their ancestry back to Tokomaru.</p>

        <p>Upper Hutt was originally inhabited by Māori tribes, including the Ngāti Tumatakokiri and Ngāti Kahungunu. These Māori tribes lived along the Hutt River, which provided them with a source of food and transportation. Here's more information about Māori settlement in the Upper Hutt area: </p>

        <p>Māori tribes living in the Upper Hutt region relied on the natural resources provided by their surroundings. The Hutt River, in particular, played a crucial role in their daily lives. The river served as a source of freshwater, a means of transportation, and a vital source of food. Fish and eels were abundant in the river and provided a reliable food source. Māori communities practised agriculture, including the cultivation of kumara (sweet potatoes) and other crops. They also engaged in hunting and gathering, taking advantage of the rich flora and fauna in the area. Māori tribes had their own unique cultural practices, traditions, and tribal structures.</p>

        <p>The Upper Hutt area's natural resources were integral to the Māori way of life. In addition to fishing and gathering, the forested hillsides provided timber for construction and materials for making tools and canoes. Canoes, in particular, were essential for river travel and transport of goods. They were often carved from large trees and played a significant role in Māori culture and trade. </p>

        <p>In the 13th century early Māori explorers Tara and his half brother Tautoki travelled south from the area now known as Hawkes Bay following the earlier exploration by Whatonga. Having arrived in the Hutt Valley they received a visitor from Hawke’s Bay who suggested that the river be named Heretaunga after the area in Hawke’s Bay. The river was previously known as Te Awa Kairangi having been named that by Kupe. Others followed from Hawke’s Bay, and villages were established along the banks of the river. Rongo living in one village named it Rongonui, which became Orongomai, the place of Rongonui. </p>

        <p>Understanding the Māori history of the Upper Hutt area helps acknowledge the region's rich cultural heritage and the enduring connection of Māori people to their ancestral lands. Today, there are ongoing efforts to promote Māori culture, language, and traditions as an integral part of New Zealand's identity and history.</p>

        <p>European exploration of New Zealand began in the late 18th century when British explorer James Cook made his first voyages to the islands in 1769 and 1770. However, it wasn't until the early 19th century that European interest in the Wellington region, including Upper Hutt, intensified. </p>

        <p>Upper Hutt was settled right at the beginning of the European colonisation of Wellington. Richard Barton, its first resident, arrived in 1840 on the “Oriental”, the second of what is known as the first four ships. He made his home at Trentham in 1841 in the area now known as Bartons Bush. The first town settler was James Brown in 1848. </p>

        <p>European settlers gradually began to arrive in the Wellington region, including the Hutt Valley. Early European settlement was often focused on agriculture, with settlers clearing land for farming, particularly pastoral activities like sheep and cattle farming. The Hutt River and the fertile land in the valley made it an attractive destination for European settlers, as it offered good agricultural potential. </p>

        <p>The arrival of Europeans in New Zealand brought about significant changes and challenges for the Māori people. While interactions varied, they often included trade, cultural exchange, and occasionally conflicts over land and resources. The early European settlers in the Hutt Valley faced hardships and challenges, including the rugged terrain and isolation. However, as the population grew and transportation infrastructure improved, the region's economy and development expanded.</p>
